# Virtuoso Sheet Music

[https://www.virtuososheetmusic.com](https://www.virtuososheetmusic.com)

Virtuoso is a concept sheet music device that is designed to replace a musician's sheet music library.
The site was done for a UW Human Centered Design & Engineering class, where our team gathered feedback from student musicians in an attempt to rediscover sheet music.
I think something like this will become the norm one day - just a matter of time.
